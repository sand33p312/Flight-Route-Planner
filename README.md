A graph-based flight planning system built to efficiently compute optimal travel routes between cities. It supports multiple routing strategies under real-world constraints like minimizing cost, time, number of stops, or combinations of them.

🚀 Features
🛫 Least Flights, Earliest Route
Finds the route with the fewest hops and earliest arrival time.

💰 Cheapest Route
Computes the minimum-cost path between two cities.

✈️ Least Flights, Cheapest Route
Optimizes both the number of flights and cost.

⛔ Cheapest Route with At Most K Stops
Uses a constrained version of Dijkstra/Bellman-Ford to limit the number of intermediate stops.
